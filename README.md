## What you will find in this repository?

#### Post Correspondence Problem Notebook
- Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem. <br />
- Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.<br />
- Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem. The function
should take two lists of strings and return True if they correspond, False otherwise.<br />
- Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory, with reference to the Post Correspondence Problem.<br />

#### Countdown Numbers Game Notebook
- Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game. <br />
- Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game. <br />
- Python function, written in a functional programming style to solve a Countdown Numbers Game. The function should take a list of six numbers and a target
number and return a method to calculate the target from the numbers, if it exists. <br />
- Explanation of the functional aspects of your code.<br />
